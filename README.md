# [RTCG](https://rtcg.repl.co/)

RTCG, or Replit Trading Card Game, is a community-led open source project made to create a Pokemon-like card index for the Replit community and its members. This repository contains the source for the API, Admin Dashboard, and CSS Library for the RTCG project. You can find the main site [here](https://rtcg.repl.co/).

### Purpose

Despite it's name, this project will not contain any game-like interactions for the card index. The purpose of this project is to build a comprehensive API for interacting *with* the card index itself. Other operations, like managing user authentication and inventory, will be handled elsewhere. While there are no plans to create a game, you're more than welcome to use the API to make one of your own!

### Contributing and Help

RTCG is currently closed to contributions, feel free to help out once we open up! If you like the project or want to find help, report a bug, or give us feedback, feel free to join our [Discord Server](https://replcardga.me/invite)!
