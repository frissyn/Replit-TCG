# RTCG Economy

These rules will outline the structure of RTCG and its economy. The economy differs from the *market* which will be organically supplied by users (i.e, trading, selling, etc.)


### Raritiy Values

|Name|Shop Value|Minting|
|----|:--------:|-------|
|Common|x0.5|âˆž|
|Uncommon|x1|~1000|
|Rare|x1.8|~750|
|Very Rare|x2.2|~500|
|Legendary|x3.8|~250|
|Unobtainable|x5|~15|

The **Shop Value** of a rarity refers to a rarity's direct monetary value. For example *Very Rare* cards will be 2.2 times more valuable than *Uncommon* cards. 

The **Minting** of a rarity refers to the maxiumum amount of copies each card will recieve before going out of print. Once a card has gone out of print, it's monetary value will increase as the only way to obtain it will be to trade for it.

**NOTE:** Limited edition cards, such as the `amasad` or `Public Beta Tester` card, will be given out by hand. This means they don't apply to the above rules.

+ You can buy cards from the Card Shop for set value.
+ Cards will **always** sell for ~5% **less** than its set value.
+ Cards you sell to the shop will be kept as copies.
+ You can buy cards in **packs**, which sell for 10% less than the total value of the individual cards together.

**Storefront:**
+ 10 Common and Uncommon cards, rotates daily
+ 5 Rare and Very Rare cards, rotates daily
+ 1 Legendary Card, rotates weekly
+ 1 Unobtainable, appears randomly for 24 hour intervals
